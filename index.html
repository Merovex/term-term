<p>The <b>Term-Term</b> dictionary used to create this list comprises 
<span id='aLen'>?????</span> adjectives and
<span id='nLen'>?????</span> nouns; 
<span id='tLen'>?????</span> possible permutations.

On page load, it shuffles both set of adjectives and nouns (deck of terms) using Fisher-Yates Shuffle methodology.
Each list generation action takes the next set of terms off the top of the term deck, ensuring no term is repeated until the next page load.
